Using Debian 11 Server (If using Virtual Machine then run it In Bridge Network)
Must use Root Login.
==============================================================================
Install Required Repos
$ apt install docker.io docker-compose git curl net-tools -y

==============================================================================
Configure Network to Set Static IP address and DNS Server.
Remember, DNS nameservers can be same as your Router's DNS

$ nano /etc/network/interfaces

Now, only change primary
    auto *your interface here. better leave it default*
    iface *your interface here again. better leave it default* inet static
    address *Desired IP address*
    netmask *Your Netmask*
    gateway *Your Router Default Gateway*
    dns-nameservers *Use Router Default Gateway as DNS*

My Settings as Example
    allow-hotplug ens33
    auto ens33
    iface ens33 inet static
        address 192.168.100.180
        netmask 255.255.255.0
        gateway 192.168.100.1
    dns-nameservers 192.168.100.1

Configure Static DNS. In file, Only change nameserver as above
$ nano /etc/resolv.conf

nameserver *dns-nameservers you used above*

Now Restart Service or Reboot System

$ systemctl restart networking
$ reboot now

==============================================================================
Now we will download Lan Cache files from Github and Setup to Run docker
$ git clone https://github.com/lancachenet/docker-compose/ lancache
$ cd lancache
$ nano .env

Now Change Some settings In file
    LANCACHE_IP is your ip address you set in /etc/network/interfaces file
    DNS_BIND_IP is again your ip address
    UPSTREAM_DNS is same as dns-nameservers

After saving the file run following command. It will download files and start the server.
$ docker-compose up -d

Check Status If Docker is running
$ docker stats

if above command show two names, lancache_dns_1 nad lancache_monolithic_1, are running in process
that means Docker is successfully Running.



=================================================================================
Disabling systemd-resolved DNSStubListener
Your downloding will not work sometime if you don't do this configuration

$ sudo -e /etc/systemd/resolved.conf    (here, Uncomment #DNSStubListener= and set it to no)
$ sudo rm /etc/resolv.conf
$ sudo ln -s /var/run/systemd/resolve/resolv.conf /etc/resolv.conf
$ sudo service systemd-resolved restart

=================================================================================
Now setup DNS in windows.
* Go to Network Properties
* Uncheck 1 with IPv6
* Click Properties of IPv4
* Click Use following DNS
    Prefered = ip address of debian you set in /etc/network/interfaces
    Alternative = Router DNS that you used in dns-nameservers
* then save it.

==================================================================================
Check If everything is working.

* Open Commandline then type and enter this command 4-5 times
    ipconfig /flushdns

* Checking If you have local lancache ip with two command. RUn Both
    nslookup steam.cache.lancache.net
    nslookup lancache.steamcontent.com

If above command show your Local Server IP Address that you set in /etc/network/interfaces
then it is working. Now you can Download Game and Test it.
To Check if server is caching.
Open Server and type:
$ docker stats

if CPU usage is going above 0.1% like more then 10-15% then it is writing to the disk

Congatulations you have successfully setup your cache server.
